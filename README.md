# Traveling Salesperson
The program calculates the shortest distance between a series of points

## General Info
The program takes an optional command line argument. If 'a' is given as a 
command line argument then the program will animate the process of finding 
the shortest path, otherwise the program will calculate the shortest path
and then will display the final result. The input for the program is read 
from stdin, first it takes the width and the height of the window that will
display the path, then it takes the total number of points to read, and then
it reads the points as (x, y) coordinates.
